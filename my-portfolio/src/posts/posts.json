Individual and accurate 3D models of every part of a piece of furniture had to be modelled using Blender. These were then set up as furniture parts in Unity which were ordered in the order they should be added within a piece of furniture. Each part came under a component and a component could either be a part of the furniture or the entire furniture itself. This meant that separate parts could be put together before being added to the furniture. For example, a drawer could be assembled by itself before being added to a bedside table. \n\nA few of the features relied on the VisionLib SDK. Parts could be tracked between real life and digital space as long as the camera could recognise an inital pose for the object. This was tricky to get right in context as the application was often used in cluttered spaces which led to the application struggling to keep track of parts. VisionLib also came with an inbuilt voice command feature. This meant that all user interaction with the application was done through voice. \n\nSome  pilot testing was carried out which concluded that the application needed some user experience improvements. Some features that were added to maximise the user friendliness were a view part command which gave users a close up, rotating view of the current part and an arrow that pointed to the current part when it exited the field of view.\n\n" }

Each group assembled a bedside table using their given instructions. Any time a participant encountered an issue, it was noted and categorised. This was used to measure the effectiveness of each set of instructions. \n\nAR proved to be effective over paper instructions, especially the animated instructions. Participants tended to select the wrong parts and place parts wrong more while reading off paper whereas AR helped them to be more sure of what a part looked like and exactly how it should be placed. The object tracking method did not get used in its intended way very often as the tracking was just too unreliable. Otherwise, the biggest issue with the AR instructions was the learning curve. Users made most of their mistakes near the start of the process but towards the end, made significanly less. \n\nThe project concluded that AR has some serious potential in improving the experience of assembling flatpack furniture. The lack of availability of hands-free AR currently is holding this back. An application which had improved object tracking a clear user guide to mitigate the learning curve would make for an excellent product. \n\n" }

The goal was to design a prototype that could eventually evolve into a full-fledged educational simulation game. The game challenges players to balance various economic variables by enacting policies and managing a budget. I was mainly responsible for developing the user interface (UI) and contributed significantly to the overall game design.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around setting policies and allocating budgets, where each policy impacts specific variables and, subsequently, other interconnected elements. After setting their strategy, players advance through turns to see the outcomes of their decisions.\n\nTo support its educational purpose, we implemented a scenario save system. This feature allows users to create custom scenarios by defining variables and their dependencies through custom formulas. The system's design allows for challenges with diverse starting conditions to be created. The game's observer pattern architecture ensures that changes to one variable automatically update all dependent variables.\n\n Developed in Unity, this project marked the team's first experience with full-scale Unity development, a valuable learning opportunity that also came with unique challenges.\n\n" }

When looking forward we created issues and used planning poker to assign them story points.\n\nMy primary role involved designing and developing the UI. This started with researching other user interface based strategy games. Using these as reference, each member of the team put together a wireframe and presented them. The best aspects from each design were agreed upon and I gathered them into a final wireframe.\n\n" }
